Welcome to my Weekday Frontend Assignment project! If you're interested, feel free to check out my portfolio at [portfolio](https://hameed-portfolio.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"}.

To save your time I have deployed the project in netlify checkout from here directly [deployed Link](https://weekday-frontend.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"}.

## Overview
This was completed with approximately 14 hours of continuous work and minimal sleep. It encompasses a frontend application with various features and optimizations aimed at delivering a stunning user experience. Below are the details of the project, including steps to run it, challenges faced, the tech stack used, and the features implemented.

## Steps to Run the Project
To run the project locally, follow these simple steps:
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Time Taken
Approximately 14 hours straight with minimal sleep.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Implementation of Filters**: Developing the filtering component from scratch took additional time.
2. **Handling Edge Cases**: Dealing with scenarios like displaying a "Results Not Found" page and providing feedback for empty search results in the dropdown presented challenges.
3. **Optimization Techniques**: Faced difficulties in implementing optimization techniques such as debouncing and throttling.

## Tech Stack Used
1. **React + TypeScript**: Utilized for type safety and preventing failures in edge cases.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Chosen for rapid UI development, despite not being explicitly mentioned in the tech stack list.
3. **No External Libraries**: Built the project without relying on external libraries, ensuring full control over dependencies.

## Features
1. **Optimized Scrolling**: Implemented `useThrottle` from scratch to optimize API calls on scroll events.
2. **Optimized Search**: Implemented `useDebounce` (without third-party libraries) to optimize search functionality in dropdown input boxes.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the site is responsive across all screen sizes without using any component library.
4. **Infinite Scroll**: Implemented infinite scroll from scratch, enhancing user experience.
5. **Shimmer UI**: Added shimmer UI to provide a smoother loading experience.
6. **Clear Filter Button**: Added a button to clear all filters at once, improving user convenience.
7. **Well-Structured Code**: Ensured files and code are well-structured and formatted for better maintainability.
